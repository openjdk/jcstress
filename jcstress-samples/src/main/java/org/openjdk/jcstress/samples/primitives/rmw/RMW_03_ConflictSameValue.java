        This test explores the behaviors of atomic RMW instructions.

        This shows the important caveat about the notion of conflict. Even if there is an intervening
        write to the same variable _that keeps the value the same_, the CAS is still guaranteed
        to succeed.

        The strong CAS should always succeed, even though there is a write to the same
        variable. Since that write brings the value still expected by the CAS, it would
        succeed.

        Indeed, on both x86_64 and AArch64 this is the result:

          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
           false            0    0.00%   Forbidden  Cannot happen
            true  515,528,704  100.00%  Acceptable  Trivial
     */

    @JCStressTest
    @Outcome(id = "true",  expect = ACCEPTABLE, desc = "Trivial")
    @Outcome(id = "false", expect = FORBIDDEN,  desc = "Cannot happen")
    public static class Strong {
        @Actor
        public void actor1(S s, Z_Result r) {
            r.r1 = S.VH.compareAndSet(s, 0, 1);
        }

        @Actor
        public void actor2(S s) {
            S.VH.setVolatile(s, 0);
        }
    }

    /*
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The weak CAS can spuriously fail, even without any conflict. But with the conflict like
        this, the chances that a weak CAS would fail are much greater. Compare with the failure
        frequency in RMW_02_ContendedSuccess.

        It would not manifest on x86_64:

          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
           false            0    0.00%  Interesting  Spurious failures are allowed
            true  430,516,224  100.00%   Acceptable  Trivial

        But it would manifest on AArch64 -XX:-UseLSE:

          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
           false    1,468,383    0.38%  Interesting  Spurious failures are allowed
            true  386,877,473   99.62%   Acceptable  Trivial
     */

    @JCStressTest
    @Outcome(id = "true",  expect = ACCEPTABLE,             desc = "Trivial")
    @Outcome(id = "false", expect = ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING, desc = "Spurious failures are allowed")
    public static class Weak {
        @Actor

            r.r1 = S.VH.weakCompareAndSet(s, 0, 1);
