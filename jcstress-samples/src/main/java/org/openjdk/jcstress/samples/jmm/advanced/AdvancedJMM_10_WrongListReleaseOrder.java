        As the extension of the previous example, in most practical cases, the wrong release order manifests
        like the premature publication on the mutating objects, for example a collection. This test initializes
        and stores/releases the initial list before doing the write. Even though the list is "volatile", the
        addition happens late, and the proper "publication" does not help.

        The "-1" outcome is very visible for obvious reasons, it is explainable by sequential execution.

        The "-2" and "-3" outcomes are possible due to simple visibility failures: the store
        to backing array is not yet visible.

        There is also a very interesting "-4" outcome, which shows that mutating collections under
        races is not a good idea. Even though isEmpty() returned "false" and we proceeded to "get",
        the internal checks in "get" read the sizes again and discovered the list is not yet initialized
        (coherence failure).
