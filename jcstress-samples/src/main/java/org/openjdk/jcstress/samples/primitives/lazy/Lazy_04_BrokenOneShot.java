        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Lazy_03_Basic gets is a whirlwind of three fields: factory, instance, set. Could we make it better by
        signaling initialized state using `factory` field itself? For example, by `null`-ing it out when it
        was used? This looks like a great idea, and it also conserves memory by not holding to the factory
        once we are done with it.

        We can write DCL based on `factory` field then. The release-acquire between releasing factory=null store
        after first use and the acquire on fast path should give us the memory ordering we want.
