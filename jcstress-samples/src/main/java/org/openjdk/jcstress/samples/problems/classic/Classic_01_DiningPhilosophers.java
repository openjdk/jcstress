        This sample shows the solutions for the classic Dining philosophers problem.
            See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

        There is a round table where philosophers sit. Every philosopher has two modes:
        thinking and eating. A philosopher needs two adjacent forks to eat. The problem
        is to write the algorithm that lets philosophers eat without deadlocks, starvation,
        and with fairness. For the purposes of this example, we don't model thinking.

        The trivial deadlock in this problem is when every philosopher holds one fork,
        and waits for other fork to drop. If all philosophers take the fork on one side,
        no philosophers would be able to complete. // TODO: Demo with multi-actor termination tests.

        The first solution is "Resource Hierarchy": it avoids the deadlock by asking the
        last philosopher to take the forks in the _different_ order.

        Indeed, no deadlock occurs:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            true  6,325,295,104  100.00%  Acceptable  Trivial.
     */

            eat(0, 1);
        }

        @Actor
        public void p2() {
            eat(1, 2);
        }

        @Actor
        public void p3() {
            eat(0, 2); // in different order
        }

        @Arbiter
        public void fake(Z_Result r) {
            // Fake the result. The actual failure is deadlock.
            r.r1 = true;
        }

        final protected void eat(int fork1, int fork2) {
            synchronized (forks[fork1]) {
                synchronized (forks[fork2]) {
                    // Forks acquired. Do nothing. Release forks on exit.
                }
            }
        }
    }

        Another solution is to introduce Arbitrator. Indeed, having a waiter to serve the forks
        solves the deadlock by not letting circular resource waits. For the purposes of this test,
        philosopher busy-wait (sic!) on a waiter.

        Note that we also synchronize the fork releases to guarantee progress. Making the fork
        accesses "opaque" would also suffice, but using the same lock on reader and writer side
        is cleaner here. See also BasicJMM_04_Progress sample.

        Indeed, no deadlock occurs:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            true  6,270,081,024  100.00%  Acceptable  Trivial.

    /*

        Yet another solution is to make sure that no more than N-1 philosopher eat at a time.
        By construction, this guarantees that last philosopher would wait for adjacent eater
        to complete before trying to acquire forks.

        Indeed, no deadlock occurs:
