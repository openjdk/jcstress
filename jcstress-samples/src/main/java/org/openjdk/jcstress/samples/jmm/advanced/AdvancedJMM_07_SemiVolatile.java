        Recasting the AdvancedJMM_06_SemiSynchronized example to volatiles, this test now exchanges the
        Composite directly between the threads. In this example, we provide strong memory semantics at the reader
        side. But the writer is left with weaker plain semantics. Like in AdvancedJMM_06_SemiSynchronized, doing
        the stronger semantics only on reader side does not solve the race. The writer can perform the writes in
        whatever order, thus revealing the surprising results even to the strong observer.

        Implementation note: this test uses VarHandles to get access to the mismatched volatile/plain ops.

        This can be seen on some platforms, for example AArch64, PPC64:

        Flipping the memory semantics, doing strong write and weak read does not fix the theoretical race,
        but most modern hardware would honor the data dependent ordering of reads. Here, reading the
        non-null Composite on most hardware would show the correct contents, provided it was published
        properly with a strong memory semantics.

        This is a corner-stone of final field semantics in Java and "Release-Consume Ordering" in C/C++.
        This does not extend to independent memory locations, as BasicJMM_06_Causality shows.

        If anyone has a DEC Alpha machine, try running this test there, as Alpha is one of a few
        known architectures that do not honor data-dependent loads, and might show Interesting outcomes
        here.

        Implementation note: this test uses VarHandles to get access to the mismatched volatile/plain ops.
