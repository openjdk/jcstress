        The next property helps some inter-thread semantics. In JMM, happens-before mandates what results are
        plausible and what are not, when non-synchronized reads are involved. That order is partial, so there
        are pairs of reads/writes we can tell nothing about order-wise.

        For example, in the case of two non-volatile variables, JMM allows observing
        "1, 0".

      We can bisect the result above a little by rewriting the test in "opaque" accesses. This way,
      we instruct optimizing compilers to keep the accesses in order, and let the hardware decide what
      semantics those accesses have.

      On x86_64, which has the Total Store Order guarantee, we would not see the interesting case anymore:

         The easiest way to solve this is to mark $y as "volatile". In this case, JMM would disallow seeing
         (1, 0). Volatile write would now be "release"-ing write and volatile read would now be "acquiring"
         read. That means all writes that precede releasing store would be visible to readers of acquiring
         read. Note this effect is only guaranteed if the acquiring read sees the value written by releasing
         write.

         Indeed, in all configurations, we shall see zero samples for the now forbidden test case.
