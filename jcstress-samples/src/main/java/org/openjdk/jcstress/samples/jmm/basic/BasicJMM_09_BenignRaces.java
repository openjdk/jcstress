       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The well established semantics under the racy accesses allows to construct the examples where
        object are published without problems via the race. This condition is known as "benign race".
        It generally follows this form:

            T get() {
                T t = instance;      // 1: SINGLE racy read
                if (t == null) {
                    t = new T(...);  // 2: SAFE, IDEMPOTENT construction
                    instance = t;    // racy store
                }
                return t;
            }

        The mechanics of this benign race is understandable: if we read something, we read it in full,
        because final field semantics saves us (see BasicJMM_08_Finals example). If we read null, then
        we can recover by creating the instance ourselves and persist it for future callers. Since
        there might be a write-write race here, it is important that construction is idempotent, so
        regardless how many threads are initializing the object, all of them would store the semantically
        identical object.

        The additional wrinkle from the JMM is the need for the single read. If we read the instance field
        once, figure out it is not null, and then read it again, we might get null on second read!
        This is similar to the BasicJMM_05_Coherence example.

        In this test, we make such failures even more likely by introducing the "eraser" actor that
        drops the reference back to null. Correctly coded benign races should stay benign.

        Indeed, "Full" test that satisfies all this conditions only sees the values we want:

        This changes if we relax either of the benign races requirements. For example, dropping "final"
        from the constructed object makes its construction unsafe, and thus we expose ourselves ot "0" outcomes.
        Indeed, that is seen on real hardware:
