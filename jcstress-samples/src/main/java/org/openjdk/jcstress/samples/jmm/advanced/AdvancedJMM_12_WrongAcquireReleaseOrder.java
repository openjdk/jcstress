        This example effectively inverts the BasicJMM_06_Causality test: it "guards" the volatile "g" with
        plain "x". The interesting outcome (1, 0) cannot be explained by the sequential execution of this code,
        nevertheless it is allowed by JMM, because it is a data race.

        Note that even if we have seen "x = 1", we can still see "g = 1". That is, adding "volatile" to "g"
        does not guarantee the _promptness_ of publishing of "g".
