        This test construct a rather complicated example when the failing CAS semantics
        matters a bit, and why a stronger primitives might be needed. Since failing RMW
        operations do not produce observable writes, the tests are complicated, and have
        to test the memory semantics in a round-about way.

        We shall build up the test case gradually. First, a very basic test.

        This test produces (0, 0), and the justifying execution is:

             w(x, 1) --po/hb--> r(y):0
                                  |
                                  |  so (not sw)
                                  v
                                r(y):0 --po/hb--> w(y, 1) --po/hb --> r(x):0

        In other words, this reads "x" through a race, and "y" has not been set yet.

        Indeed, this is clearly visible on AArch64:

            }

        }
    }

        Replacing both non-atomic checks with CAS yields the example that still produces
        (0, 0). The justifying execution for that outcome is:

             w(x, 1) --po/hb--> [ r(y):0; nothing happens ]
                                         |
                                         |  so (not sw)
                                         v
                                [ r(y):0; w(y, 1) ] --po/hb --> r(x):0

        ...where CAS actions are "indivisible" in "[ ]".

        The fact these are atomic CASes changes nothing (yet): there is no store,
        and therefore no memory semantics can be assumed.

        Indeed, this still happens on AArch64:
          RESULT     SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION

        Doing the store to provide the release on one side still produces (0, 0),
        and the justifying execution is:

        w(x,1) --po/hb--> r(y):0 --po/hb--> w(y,0)
                            |                 ^
                            | so              | so
                            v                 |
                        [ r(y):0     ;     w(y,1) ] --po/hb--> r(x):0

        It is similar as before, and the fact there is an unconditional volatile write
        changes nothing (yet).

        Note that the order over "y" is still linearizable, as required for synchronization
        actions: r(y):0 --> r(y):0 --> w(y,1) --> w(y, 0).

        Indeed, this is still possible on AArch64:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Now to the final test. This test cannot produce (0, 0), because it uses a much stronger
        primitive: Get-And-Set (GAS).

        To reason whether we can produce (0, 0), we basically need to fill in the blanks
        in between the actions in GAS and CAS:

        w(x,1) --po/hb--> [ r(y):0 ; w(y,0) ]

                               ????????

                          [ r(y):0 ; w(y,1) ] --po/hb--> r(x):0

        The important thing is that both are *atomic*, which means we cannot split the
        first read-write pair like in the example before. Which means this execution
        is no longer valid:

        w(x,1) --po/hb--> [ r(y):0 ; w(y,0) ]
                              |         ^
                              | so      | so
                              v         |
                          [ r(y):0 ; w(y,1) ] --po/hb--> r(x):0

        The two valid executions are where both atomic groups are sequenced one after another.
        There are two such executions, and both executions are invalid.

        This execution is invalid, because r(y):0 should have observed w(y,1), which
        fails synchronization order consistency.

        w(x,1) --po/hb--> [ r(y):0 ; w(y,0) ]
                              ^
                              \---------\
                                        |
                          [ r(y):0 ; w(y,1) ] --po/hb--> r(x):0

        This execution is invalid, because r(y) observes w(y), which means there
        is a synchronizes-with between them, which hooks w(x) and r(x), which
        fails happens-before consistency: r(x) should see 1.

        w(x,1) --po/hb--> [ r(y):0 ; w(y,0) ]
                                        |
                              /--sw/hb--/
                              v
                          [ r(y):0 ; w(y,1) ] --po/hb--> r(x):0

        In the end, there is no execution that justifies (0, 0).

        Note that it is an effect of all three:
          - GAS is being atomic;
          - GAS is carrying "release" semantics;
          - GAS is performing the unconditional store is detectable by CAS;

        Previous examples show how failing any of these prerequisites exposes (0, 0).

        Indeed, this does not happen on AArch64 anymore:
