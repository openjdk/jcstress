        This tests explores a more advanced property of CASes:
          - for strong CASes, exactly one operation should succeed
          - for weak CASes, at most one operation should succeed (accept spurious failures)

        The weak CASes are normally only seen on the platforms that implement LL/SC-based atomics,
        so these tests are good to run on AArch64 without LSE atomics (in Hotspot, this is achieved
        with -XX:-UseLSE).

        The strong CAS should always succeed, as long as there is no conflicts.

        Indeed, on both x86_64 and AArch64 this is the result:

                RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
          false, false            0    0.00%   Forbidden  Not even once
           false, true  232,042,522   52.44%  Acceptable  Trivial
           true, false  210,454,502   47.56%  Acceptable  Trivial
            true, true            0    0.00%   Forbidden  More than once

        @Actor
        public void actor2(S s, ZZ_Result r) {
            r.r2 = S.VH.compareAndSet(s, 0, 1);

        The weak CAS can spuriously fail, even without any conflict, but otherwise they
        cannot succeed both.

        It would not manifest on x86_64:

                RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
          false, false            0    0.00%  Interesting  Not even once
           false, true  240,890,038   51.04%   Acceptable  Trivial
           true, false  231,108,426   48.96%   Acceptable  Trivial
            true, true            0    0.00%    Forbidden  More than once

        But it would manifest on AArch64 -XX:-UseLSE:

                RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
          false, false          385   <0.01%  Interesting  Not even once
           false, true  152,343,703   48.79%   Acceptable  Trivial
           true, false  159,898,088   51.21%   Acceptable  Trivial
