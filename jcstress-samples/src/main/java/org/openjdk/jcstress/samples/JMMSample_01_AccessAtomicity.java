        While the spec requirements for field and array element accesses are
        strict, the implementations of concrete classes may have a relaxed
        semantics. Take ByteBuffer where we can read the 4-byte integer from
        an arbitrary offset.

        Older ByteBuffer implementations accessed one byte at a time, and that
        required merging/splitting anything larger than a byte into the individual
        operations. Of course, there is no access atomicity there by construction.
        In newer ByteBuffer implementations, the _aligned_ accesses are done with
        larger instructions that gives back atomicity. Misaligned accesses would
        still have to do several narrower accesses on machines that don't support
        misalignments.

        Conclusion: for fields and array elements access atomicity is guaranteed, except
        for non-volatile longs and doubles. Regaining the atomicity is possible with anything
        stronger than a plain read/write.

        Are reads/writes atomic?

                        boolean,    byte,   char,   short,     int,    float,  double,  long,   Object

          plain:            yes      yes     yes      yes      yes       yes       NO     NO      yes
          volatile:         yes      yes     yes      yes      yes       yes      YES    YES      yes

          VH (plain):       yes      yes     yes      yes      yes       yes       NO     NO      yes
          VH (opaque):      yes      yes     yes      yes      yes       yes      YES    YES      yes
          VH (acq/rel):     yes      yes     yes      yes      yes       yes      YES    YES      yes
          VH (volatile):    yes      yes     yes      yes      yes       yes      YES    YES      yes

        Access atomicity for unnatural accesses is not guaranteed. Alignment issues,
        implementation quirks, etc. may deconstruct the access atomicity. The case of single
        aligned reads/writes is similar to the usual language guarantees.

        Are reads/writes atomic?

                                                   access type:
                                    multiple,   single misaligned,  single aligned

          plain:                           no                  no,          YES/NO (yes, except for long/double)
