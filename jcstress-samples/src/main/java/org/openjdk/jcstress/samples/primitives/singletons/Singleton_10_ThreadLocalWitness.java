        Original DCL paper shows another quirky example:
          https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html#ThreadLocal

        What if we were able to track whether the thread already visited the slow path, and thus guaranteed
        to have seen or installed the new instance? This works, at the expense of quite expensive ThreadLocal
        lookup on fast path.
