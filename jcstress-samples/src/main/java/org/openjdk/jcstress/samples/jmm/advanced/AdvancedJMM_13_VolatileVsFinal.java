        Perhaps, one of the most surprising JMM behaviors is that volatile fields do not include
        the final field semantics. That is, if we publish the reference to the object racily,
        then we can see the default value for the "volatile" field! This is mostly because the
        volatile itself is in the wrong place. This is similar to previous AdvancedJMM_12_WrongAcquireReleaseOrder
        example.

        It can be seen on some platforms with this synthetic test.

        For example, AArch64:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
              -1  1,428,517,070   91.74%   Acceptable  Boring
               0          7,105   <0.01%  Interesting  Whoa
              42    128,534,641    8.25%   Acceptable  Boring

        Notably, some platforms go beyond the formal JMM requirement, and forbid this result.

        For example, PPC64:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
              -1  2,085,381,011   75.77%   Acceptable  Boring
               0              0    0.00%  Interesting  Whoa
              42    666,849,645   24.23%   Acceptable  Boring
     */

    public static class Synthetic {

            }
        }

        Holder h;

        @Actor
        void thread1() {
            h = new Holder();
        }

        @Actor

                r.r1 = -1;

        The real life consequence of this rule is racy publication of otherwise thread-safe classes,
        like AtomicInteger.

        Again, on AArch64:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
              -1  1,358,737,999   90.09%   Acceptable  Boring
