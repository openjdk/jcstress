        Another example elaborates on conflict behavior.

        This example shows that even with the weakest form of RMW (CAS), without any memory ordering
        whatsoever, we are still covered by coherence (see BasicJMM_05_Coherence example). That is,
        a conflicting RMW operation cannot see the "stale" value and succeed to update the location
        the second time.

        In this example, even though the store of "1" happens concurrently with both CASes,
        only one CAS is allowed to succeed. This test specifically uses the weakest non-barrier
        form of CAS to point that it is the property of the accesses themselves, not their
        implied memory ordering.

        Indeed, on all platforms (x86_64, AArch64, PPC64), this would happen:
                RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
          false, false    672,734,373   15.43%  Acceptable  Not even once
           false, true  1,757,321,910   40.31%  Acceptable  Trivial
           true, false  1,929,492,645   44.26%  Acceptable  Trivial
            true, true              0    0.00%   Forbidden  More than once

        Both CASes can fail (they are weak, and the store to "1" might not happen yet), but
        they never succeed at the same time.
