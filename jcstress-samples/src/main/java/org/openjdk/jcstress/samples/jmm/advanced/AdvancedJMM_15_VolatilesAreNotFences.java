        Similarly to AdvancedJMM_14_SynchronizedAreNotFences example, the volatile accesses cannot be reliably
        used for their auxiliary memory effects. In this example, if we do not observe the write of the "b", then
        we can see the old "x", even though volatile accesses _might_ be implemented with barriers.

        This reproduces on AArch64:

        Once again, using the fences directly helps to get the effect that we want.
