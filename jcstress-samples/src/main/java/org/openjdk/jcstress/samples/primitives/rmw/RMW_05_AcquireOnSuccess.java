        This test shows that CAS provides "acquire" semantics on success. This is similar
        to other tests, for example BasicJMM_06_Causality: once we observe something
        "release"-d by another thread, using any primitive with "acquire" semantics,
        we are guaranteed to see things that happened before that release.

        Indeed, on both x86_64 and AArch64 this would happen:
          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            0, 0  138,542,022   42.99%  Acceptable  Trivial
            0, 1    3,232,097    1.00%  Acceptable  Trivial
            1, 0            0    0.00%   Forbidden  Cannot happen
            1, 1  180,464,345   56.00%  Acceptable  Trivial
