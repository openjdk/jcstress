        One naively can expect that writes to variables are eventually visible. However, under Java Memory Model,
        this does not apply to plain reads and writes. The usual example is the busy loop in plain field.
        The optimizing compiler is allowed to check the field once, and if it is "false", reduce the rest of
        the loop into "while(true)", infinite version.

        Indeed, running this on just about any platform yields:

              RESULT  SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
               STALE        4   50.00%  Interesting  Test is stuck
          TERMINATED        4   50.00%   Acceptable  Gracefully finished
      */

    @JCStressTest(Mode.Termination)
    @Outcome(id = "TERMINATED", expect = ACCEPTABLE,             desc = "Gracefully finished")
    @Outcome(id = "STALE",      expect = ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING, desc = "Test is stuck")
    @State
    public static class PlainSpin {
        boolean ready;

        @Actor
        public void actor1() {
            while (!ready); // spin
        }

        @Signal
        public void signal() {
            ready = true;
        }
    }

        Making the field "volatile" is the surefire way to achieve progress guarantees.
        All volatile writes are eventually visible, so the loop eventually terminates.

        Indeed, this is guaranteed to happen on all platforms:

              RESULT  SAMPLES    FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
               STALE        0    0.0%  Interesting  Test is stuck
          TERMINATED   17,882  100.0%   Acceptable  Gracefully finished
     */

    @JCStressTest(Mode.Termination)
    @Outcome(id = "TERMINATED", expect = ACCEPTABLE,             desc = "Gracefully finished")
    @Outcome(id = "STALE",      expect = ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING, desc = "Test is stuck")
    @State
    public static class VolatileSpin {
        volatile boolean ready;

        @Actor
        public void actor1() {
            while (!ready); // spin
        }

        @Signal
        public void signal() {
            ready = true;
        }
    }

        In fact, the overwhelming majority of hardware makes writes eventually visible, so what we minimally
        want is to make the accesses opaque to the optimizing compilers. Luckily, that is simple to do with
        VarHandles.{set|get}Opaque.

        Indeed, this is guaranteed to happen on all platforms:

              RESULT  SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
               STALE        0    0.00%   Forbidden  Test is stuck
          TERMINATED   17,902  100.00%  Acceptable  Gracefully finished
     */

    @JCStressTest(Mode.Termination)
    @Outcome(id = "TERMINATED", expect = ACCEPTABLE, desc = "Gracefully finished")
    @Outcome(id = "STALE",      expect = FORBIDDEN,  desc = "Test is stuck")
    @State
    public static class OpaqueSpin {
        static final VarHandle VH;

        static {
            try {
                VH = MethodHandles.lookup().findVarHandle(OpaqueSpin.class, "ready", boolean.class);
            } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(e);
            }
        }

        boolean ready;

        @Actor
        public void actor1() {
            while (!(boolean)VH.getOpaque(this)); // spin
        }

        @Signal
        public void signal() {
            VH.setOpaque(this, true);
        }
    }

        For completeness, writing and reading the variable under explicit synchronization
        also provides the progress guarantees. The writes under one thread releasing the lock
        are visible to the thread subsequently acquiring the lock. Therefore, the loop eventually
        terminates.

        Indeed, this is guaranteed to happen on all platforms:

              RESULT  SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
               STALE        0    0.00%  Interesting  Test is stuck

        boolean ready;
