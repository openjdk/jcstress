        This test explores the behaviors of atomic RMW instructions.

        It starts from a very basic property: whether the uncontended compare-and-set instruction
        completes successfully every time, or not. This test highlights the difference between
        "strong" and "weak" CASes.

        The weak CASes are normally only seen on the platforms that implement LL/SC-based atomics,
        so these tests are good to run on AArch64 without LSE atomics (in Hotspot, this is achieved
        with -XX:-UseLSE).

        The strong CAS should always succeed, as long as there is no conflicts.

        Indeed, on both x86_64 and AArch64 this is the result:

          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
           false            0    0.00%   Forbidden  Cannot happen
            true  128,018,432  100.00%  Acceptable  Trivial
     */

    @JCStressTest
    @Outcome(id = "true",  expect = ACCEPTABLE, desc = "Trivial")
    @Outcome(id = "false", expect = FORBIDDEN,  desc = "Cannot happen")
    public static class Strong {
        @Actor
        public void actor(S s, Z_Result r) {
            r.r1 = S.VH.compareAndSet(s, 0, 1);
        }
    }

    /*
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The weak CAS can spuriously fail, even without any conflict.

        It would not manifest on x86_64:

          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
           false            0    0.00%  Interesting  Spurious failures are allowed
            true  125,427,712  100.00%   Acceptable  Trivial

        But it would manifest on AArch64 -XX:-UseLSE:

          RESULT     SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
           false         321   <0.01%  Interesting  Spurious failures are allowed
            true  76,365,503  100.00%   Acceptable  Trivial
     */

    @JCStressTest
    @Outcome(id = "true",  expect = ACCEPTABLE,             desc = "Trivial")
    @Outcome(id = "false", expect = ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING, desc = "Spurious failures are allowed")
