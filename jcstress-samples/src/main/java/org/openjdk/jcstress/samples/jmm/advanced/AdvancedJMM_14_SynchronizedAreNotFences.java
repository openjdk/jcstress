        This example is superficially similar to AdvancedJMM_01_SynchronizedBarriers, but this time it shows
        that relying on the "synchronized" just for the memory effects is not reliable. Notably, the constructions
        that use no-op synchronized blocks are routinely elided by optimizers. This test produces the interesting
        result more or less reliably, by using "new Object()" as synchronization target. Choosing a different
        target may mask the interesting result, but it can reappear in real programs after aggressive optimizations.

        On x86_64 this test yields:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            0, 0    704,537,467   18.23%   Acceptable  Boring

        If fence-like effects are required in low-level concurrency code, then Unsafe.*Fence should be used instead.

        Indeed, this provides the effect we are after, on all platforms:
