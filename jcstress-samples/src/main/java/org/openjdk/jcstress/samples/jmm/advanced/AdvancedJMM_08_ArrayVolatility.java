        It is easy to misplace volatiles when arrays are used. Notably, declaring the array itself "volatile"
        does not make the accesses to its elements "volatile". This is similar to declaring the field that store
        a reference to class "volatile": it would not translate to those fields being "volatile".

        Therefore, this test yields:

          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            0, 0  266,067,332   69.40%   Acceptable  Boring
            0, 1       31,968   <0.01%   Acceptable  Okay
            1, 0       67,654    0.02%  Interesting  Whoa
            1, 1  117,191,510   30.57%   Acceptable  Boring

        That is, the write to a[1] does not cause updates of a[0] to be visible.

        VarHandles provide the possibility to perform volatile accesses by using the "volatile" access mode.
        In this example, a[1] element works as volatile guard see in BasicJMM_06_Causality primers.

        Indeed, this would be the result on all platforms:
          RESULT      SAMPLES     FREQ      EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            0, 0  308,853,172   78.55%  Acceptable  Boring
            0, 1       39,632    0.01%  Acceptable  Okay
            1, 0            0    0.00%   Forbidden  Whoa
