        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        This test starts the discussion on more advanced topic: creating Lazy<T>, a lazy factory for the object.
        Lazy<T> looks deceptively like a singleton, and it is nearly that. Look through Singleton samples before
        continuing here.

        We will start building out the implementation that is based on double-checked locking from Singleton_05_DCL.
        This time we would give a supplier to a constructor.

        See Lazy.map(...) to understand the state that test verifies.

        There are two major problems with a common cause. Since `Lazy.factory` field is not final,
        publishing `Lazy` instance racily leaves that field in bad state. Sometimes we see `factory == null`,
        and this causes the internal exception. Sometimes we see `factory != null`, but the internal Supplier
        state is broken: it _thinks_ it was already called (`HolderSupplier.first == false`)!

        This further expands on BasicJMM_08_Finals. `final` fields are not only hygienic practice,
        they have concurrent safety implications.
