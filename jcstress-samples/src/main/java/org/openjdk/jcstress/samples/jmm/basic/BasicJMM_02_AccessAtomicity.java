        under 17.7 "Non-Atomic Treatment of double and long". It says that longs and
        doubles could be treated non-atomically.

        While the spec requirements for field and array element accesses are strict, the implementations of
        concrete classes may have a relaxed semantics. Take ByteBuffer where we can read the 4-byte integer
        from an arbitrary offset.

        Older ByteBuffer implementations accessed one byte at a time, and that required merging/splitting
        anything larger than a byte into the individual operations. Of course, there is no access atomicity
        there by construction. In newer ByteBuffer implementations, the _aligned_ accesses are done with
        larger instructions that gives back atomicity. Misaligned accesses would still have to do several
        narrower accesses on machines that don't support misalignments.

        While most modern hardware implementation provide access atomicity for all Java primitive types,
        the issue with access atomicity raises it ugly head again with Project Valhalla, which strives
        to introduce multi-field classes that behave like primitives. There, reading the entirety of
        the "inlined" ("flattened") primitive type is sometimes not possible, because the effective
        data type width is too large. Therefore, we would normally see access atomicity violations.
