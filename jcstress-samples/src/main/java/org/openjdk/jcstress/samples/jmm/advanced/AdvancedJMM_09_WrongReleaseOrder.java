        Remember, it is critically important that proper release-acquire chains follows the proper structure:
           A --before--> release --sees--> acquire --before--> B

        Only this way we can guarantee that B sees A. This test is one of the exploratory tests what bad
        things happen when that rule is violated. This example differs from BasicJMM_05_Coherence by doing
        the release in wrong order.

        This test yields:
          RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
            0, 0  2,285,705,011   53.75%   Acceptable  Boring
            0, 1      3,023,487    0.07%   Acceptable  Plausible
            1, 0     17,424,594    0.41%  Interesting  Whoa
            1, 1  1,946,573,692   45.77%   Acceptable  Boring

        The "1, 0" outcome is now eminently possible and can be explained by a simple sequential execution.
