        The basic test shows that returning `null` from factory exposes a logic bug: since our
        "uninitialized" state is tracked as `null`, we cannot disambiguate the cases of legitimate `null`-s
        returned by factory, and the `null`-s as uninitialized state. So we end up calling the factory
        all the time. It would be okay if factory was fully idempotent, but it might not be, and calling
        it multiple times is certainly not lazy.
