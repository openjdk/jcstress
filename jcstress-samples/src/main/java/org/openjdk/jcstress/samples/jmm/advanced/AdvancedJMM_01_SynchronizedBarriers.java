         This is the first example that shows the advanced things in JMM. Most of these examples show
         what JMM is *not*, rather that what JMM *is*.

         It is easy to read "JSR 133 Cookbook for Compiler Writers" and get a wrong idea that the conservative
         implementation that JSR 133 Cookbook provides as the implementation guidance is the memory
         model as specified. For example, it is a common mistake to assume that synchronized blocks
         have barriers associated with them.

         In this example, we do two back-to-back synchronized blocks in one thread, and read the updates
         in the other thread with the maximum ordering possible, "volatile". If synchronized blocks indeed
         provided the barriers, then it would not be possible to write "x" and "y" out of order, and
         therefore, "1, 0" outcome would be forbidden.

         But in reality, even on x86_64, this test yields:

              RESULT        SAMPLES     FREQ       EXPECT  DESCRIPTION
                0, 0  3,815,999,238   92.96%   Acceptable  Boring
                0, 1     10,345,809    0.25%   Acceptable  In order
                1, 0        207,479   <0.01%  Interesting  Whoa
                1, 1    278,646,578    6.79%   Acceptable  Boring

         Technically, this is due to "lock coarsening" that merged the synchronized blocks, and then was able
         to order the writes to "x" and "y" differently. JMM as stated allows this optimization: we are only
         required to see these stores in order if we are synchronizing on the same "this". Side observers can
         see the writes in whatever order.
