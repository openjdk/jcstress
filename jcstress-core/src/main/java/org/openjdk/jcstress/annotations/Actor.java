/**
 * {@link Actor} is the central test annotation. It marks the methods that hold the

 *
 * <p>Note that the invocation order against other {@link Actor} methods is deliberately
 * not specified. Therefore, two or more {@link Actor} methods may be used to model
 * the concurrent execution on data held by {@link State} instance.
 *
 * <p>Actor-annotated methods can have only the {@link State} or {@link Result}-annotated
 * classes as the parameters. Actor methods may declare to throw the exceptions, but
 * actually throwing the exception would fail the test.
