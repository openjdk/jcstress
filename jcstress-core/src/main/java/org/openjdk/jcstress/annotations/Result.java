/**
 * {@link Result} annotation marks the result object. This annotation is seldom
 * useful for user code, because jcstress ships lots of pre-canned result classes,
 * see {@link org.openjdk.jcstress.infra.results} package.
 *
 * <p/>Important invariants and properties:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>All fields in {@link Result} classes should be public.</li>
 *     <li>All fields in {@link Result} classes shoudl be either primitive, or String.</li>
 *     <li>{@link Result} classes should be serializable.</li>
 *     <li>{@link Result} classes should have proper {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()}
 *     methods to disambiguate one result from another.</li>
 *     <li>{@link Result} classes should have unique {@link #toString()} representation,
 *     because it is being matched with {@link Outcome#id()}, and also serves
 *     as key to separate one result from another in the output log.
 *     (This might be revisited in future releases of jcstress).</li>
 *     <li>{@link Result} classes mimic value types. They do not have identity,
 *     and jcstress may reuse the objects, auto-magically clear the result fields,
 *     etc. It is not advisable to have auxiliary fields and methods in {@link Result}
 *     class, because its state is managed by jcstress.</li>
 * </ol>
